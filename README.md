# Mapping alt JSON

This repository provides R utilities to **map**, **compare**, and **clean** `alt` JSON files.

```r
source("altCode.R")

# If delete = FALSE, then it will only list what files (with directory path) will be deleted
# Usage:
altClean(188, delete = FALSE)
# altClean(188, delete = TRUE)

```

```r
source("code_data_estraction.R")
